Load all necessary packages
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(p8105.datasets)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(ggridges)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(hexbin)

## Problem 1

Load the dataset
```{r}
data("ny_noaa")
```

Exploration of dataset
```{r}
str(ny_noaa)
ny_noaa =
  ny_noaa|>
  mutate(
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin)
    )
summary(ny_noaa)
```
The dataset consists of 7 variables with 2,595,176 observations. 
The variables includes:
id: Weather station ID
date: Date of observation
prcp: Precipitation (tenths of mm)
snow: Snowfall (mm)
snwd: Snow depth (mm)
tmax: Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
tmin: Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
About half of the dataset consists of missing data for tmin and tmax which can 
be an issue if analyze as a whole.

Data cleaning
```{r}
ny_noaa_cleaned = 
  ny_noaa |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    year = year(date),
    month = month(date),
    day = day(date),
    prcp = prcp / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10, 
    tmin = tmin / 10  
  )
ny_noaa_cleaned |>
  filter(!is.na(snow)) |>
  count(snow, , sort = TRUE) |>
  slice(1)
```

The year, month, and day variables have been creatted using the lubridate 
package. Variables with tenth of a standard units have been divided by 10.
For snowfall, the most commonly observed value is 0 as snowfall does not occur 
on most days throughout the year in most locations. 

Two-panel graph for mean tmax
```{r}
ny_noaa_cleaned |>
  group_by(id, year, month) |>
  filter(month %in% c(1, 7)) |> 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE, color = id)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, group = id)) + geom_point() + geom_path() +
  facet_grid(~month) +
  labs(title = "Mean monthly temperature for each station across years for January and July")
```

Plot for snowfall
```{r}
hex = 
  ny_noaa_cleaned |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_hex()

ridge = 
  ny_noaa_cleaned |> 
  filter(snow < 100, snow > 0) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = snow, y = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_density_ridges()

hex + ridge
```

## Problem 2

Load the datasets and merge them
```{r message = FALSE}
demo_df = 
  read_csv("nhanes_covar.csv", na = c("NA", "", "."), skip = 4) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  filter(age >= 21) |>
  mutate(
    sex = case_match(sex, 
                    1 ~ "Male", 
                    2 ~ "Female"),
    education = case_match(education, 
                       1 ~ "Less than high school", 
                       2 ~ "High school equivalent", 
                       3 ~ "More than high school")
  ) |>
  drop_na()

accel_df = 
  read_csv("nhanes_accel.csv",na = c("NA", "", ".")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() 

merged_df = 
  accel_df |>
  inner_join(demo_df, by = "seqn")
```

Create the table
```{r}
merged_df |>
  count(sex, education) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n) |>
  kable()
```
The distribution of males and females across education levels seems relatively balanced. However, there are slightly more females in the "More than high school" category and slightly more males in the "High school equivalent" category.

Create the age distributio plot
```{r}
merged_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  theme_minimal()
```
High School Equivalent:  
Females: There is a noticeable peak in the 60-80 age range, indicating a higher concentration of older females in this education group.
Males: The male distribution shows more variability, with one peak around 40-60 years and another peak at 70-80 years.

Less than High School:  
Females: The age distribution for females in this group is relatively flat, with a slight peak in the 40-60 year age range. There is also some density in the 70-80 range.
Males: Similar to females, but with a more noticeable peak in the 60-70 year range.

More than High School:  
Females: The distribution of females shows a peak in the 40-60 year range, with a gradual decline after 60 years.
Males: The distribution is spread more evenly , with noticeable peaks around the 30-50 and 60-70 age ranges.

Total activity vs. age
```{r}
activity_df = 
  merged_df |>
  mutate(total_activity = rowSums(across(starts_with("min")), na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  select(seqn, sex, age, bmi, education, total_activity)

activity_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +  
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  theme_minimal()
```
High School Equivalent:  
Females: Showed a generally higher activity level compared to males, with a 
decrease in total activity after 40 (but a slight increase at 60).
Males: Maintained a more consistent level of activity over age, but also with a 
decline in total activity in 40s.

Less than High School:  
The activity levels for both males and females show a decline as age increases, 
particularly after the age of 60.
Females: Gradual decline in activity starting from around age 40.
Males: Initially have slightly higher total activity than females in younger 
age groups (20-40), but also with sharp drop in total activity after age 60.

More than High School:  
Females: Total activity is about steady at an ealier age (20-40), followed by a 
decline around age 60.
Males: A little more fluctuations in activity but generally seem to maintain a 
similar level over a wide age range (20-50), with a noticeable decline after 50.

24 hours activity
```{r message = FALSE}
merged_df |>
  group_by(sex, education) |>
  summarise(across(starts_with("min"), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("min"), names_to = "minute", values_to = "mean_activity") |>
  mutate(hour = as.numeric(sub("min", "", minute)) / 60) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = mean_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  theme_minimal()
```
The overall pattern for the three education levels all follows a typical daily 
activity curve, with activity rising sharply in the morning (around 5-6 AM), 
peaking around mid-day, and declining sharply after 8 PM.

High School Equivalent:  
Both males and females show similar activity patterns, with peaks in activity 
occurring between 6 AM and 8 PM. Females have a slightly higher average activity
level than males throughout the day, particularly during the mid-day hours 
(10 AM - 4 PM).


Less than High School:  
Males have slightly higher activity levels in the morning (before 8-9 AM) than
females, and females have higher activity levels after 9 AM, but the trends are  
close. 

More than High School:  
There is higher activity in females compared to males throughout the day.


## Problem 3

import the datasets and combine
```{r message = FALSE}
Jan_20 = 
  read_csv("citibike/Jan 2020 Citi.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

Jul_20 = 
  read_csv("citibike/July 2020 Citi.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

Jan_24 = 
  read_csv("citibike/Jan 2024 Citi.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

Jul_24 = 
  read_csv("citibike/July 2024 Citi.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

citibike_df = 
  bind_rows(
  Jan_20 |> 
    mutate(month = "January", year = 2020),
  Jan_24 |>
    mutate(month = "January", year = 2024),
  Jul_20 |> 
    mutate(month = "July", year = 2020),
  Jul_24 |> 
    mutate(month = "July", year = 2024)
)
```

Create the table
```{r}
citibike_df |>
  group_by(year, month, member_casual) |>
  summarise(total_rides = n()) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = member_casual, values_from = total_rides) |>
  kable()
```
There is a significant increase in both casual and member rides from 2020 to 
2024.  
Casual rides more than doubled in both January and July between 2020 and 2024. 
For example, casual rides in July grew from 5,637 in 2020 to 10,894 in 2024.
Member rides also saw a significant increase. For example. member rides grew 
to 36,262 in July 2024, more than double the 15,411 member rides in July 2020.

effects of day of the week, month, and year on median ride duration
```{r}
citibike_df |>
   mutate(weekdays = factor(weekdays, 
                           levels = 
                             c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", 
                               "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"),
                           ordered = TRUE)) |>
  group_by(weekdays, month, year) |>
  summarise(median_duration = median(duration, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = weekdays, y = median_duration, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_line(aes(group = year)) +
  facet_wrap(~month) +
  labs(x = "Day of the Week", y = "Median Ride Duration (minutes)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```
Ride durations are generally longer in July compared to January, which aligns 
with expectations as summer months typically encourage longer rides due to 
favorable weather (warmer).  
Both years and both months show that ride durations tend to increase over the 
weekend (especially Saturdays), which suggests that more people may be using 
Citi Bikes for leisure rides during the weekends.  
While both 2020 and 2024 show similar patterns, the median ride duration in 
2024 is lower than in 2020.  

impact of month, membership status, and bike type on ride duration for 2024
```{r}
citibike_df |>
  filter(year == 2024) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = duration, fill = rideable_type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(month ~ member_casual) +
  labs(x = "Ride Duration (minutes)", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
citibike_df |>
  filter(year == 2024) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = duration, fill = rideable_type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +

  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 60)) +
  labs(x = "Ride Duration (minutes)", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Casual and Member Riders:  
Casual riders (left panels) tend to have slightly longer ride durations 
compared to members (right panels). This can be seen in the broader distribution 
of ride durations for casual riders. Members show a more concentrated 
distribution around short ride durations (heavily concentrated below 20 minutes).

Effect of Month:  
In both January and July, ride durations for members are shorter and more 
tightly distributed than for casual riders. This trend is consistent across 
both months. Ride durations appear to be slightly longer in July compared to 
January, especially for casual riders.

Bike Types:  
Electric bikes (shown in blue) have a tighter concentration around shorter ride 
durations for both casual and member riders, suggesting they are typically used 
for quick trips. Classic bikes (in red) appear to have a slightly broader 
distribution, especially among casual riders.
